- Check the code style using Google's standard Java checkstyle and fail if warnings are encountered.
- Test the SpringBoot Application and fail if 1 or more tests fail.

**Force Pushes and Commits to main are not allowed, and will be rejected by GitHub.**

Every PR into `main` must have at least `1` approved review before merging. The merged branch will be deleted hereafter.
